# Sparkles

âœ¨ FREE INTERNET POINTSâ„¢!!! âœ¨

Sparkles is a Slack App that allows users to gift each other Internet Pointsâ„¢. 

The number of points accumulated by a user is stored and will be proudly displayed every time the user is sparkled again.

To start, add `@Sparkles` to the intended channel. Then, type the name of the user followed by an empty space and `++`. As in:

```
@Sparkles ++
```

Sparkles will reply on the channel with the total tally for the user. For example:

```
âœ¨ Huzzah! @Sparkles now has 42 Internet Pointsâ„¢ ðŸ¥³
```
